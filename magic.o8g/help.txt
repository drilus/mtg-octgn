This is the Magic: the Gathering Game Definition for OCTGN.  You can always find the latest information on running M:tG with oCTGN at http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com.

This game definition features the Autoscript system (developed by brine), which includes the Stack, card alignment, and simple automation.  This system can be disabled by selecting "Enable/Disable Autoscripts" in the Table's right-click menu, and is always Enabled by default.

The Stack is designed to simulate the actual Stack found in the Magic rules. Actions such as casting a spell or activating/triggering an ability will place that card on the Stack zone in the table.  In the case of an activated/triggered ability, a copy of that card will go on the stack instead of the original card.  While on the Stack, each card will have various rectangular-shaped icons which help you identify the type of object that card represents.  Double-clicking on a card you control on the stack will resolve that spell/ability, and using the DEL hotkey will counter it.

Casting a spell, activating or triggering an ability, or resolving an object on the stack may also perform certain functions automatically.  For example, resolving the card 'Midnight Haunting' will automatically create two spirit tokens on the table for you.  These automations are simple and not designed to carry out complex card interactions or enforce game rules.  There are a lot of Magic cards available and many of them will not be automated, but we are working hard to expand the number of cards which are supported.

Add a Smart Counter (CTRL+SHIFT+S)
